# Capstone-Project

This app is my capstone project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

###Appointment Scheduler

Have you ever tried to keep track of appointments for your church or other organization? This
app will help you manage those appointments, from making the initial appointment to
rescheduling appointments, and following up. Never double book an appointment again!

This app is intended for organization secretaries that need to make and manage 
appointments for their group.

#####Features
* Schedule appointments
* Reschedule appointments
* Send schedule to interviewers

#####Getting Started
In order to begin setting and tracking appointments, you will need to add the members to choose 
from.  At least one of those members should be set as an interviewer.  Once the list of members
is complete, you are ready to begin setting appointments and tracking them!
